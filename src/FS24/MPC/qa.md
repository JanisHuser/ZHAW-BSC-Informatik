Here are comprehensive answers to all 44 questions extracted from the document:

1. **Where have we seen reduction before?**
   - Reduction is used in array operations where multiple elements are combined using an operation (e.g., sum, min, max) to produce a single result.

2. **What is the data scope of the variables in the following code?**
   ```c
   #include <omp.h>

   int i = 0; int n = 10; int a = 7; 

   #pragma omp parallel for 

   for (i = 0; i < n; i++) 
   { 
       int b = a + i; 
       ... 
   }
   ```
   - `i` and `b` are private to each thread, while `n` and `a` are shared among threads.

3. **What is the data scope of the variables in the following code?**
   ```c
   #include <omp.h>

   #pragma omp parallel for shared(n, a) 

   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
   { 
       int b = a + i; 
       ... 
   }

   #pragma omp parallel for shared(n, a) private(b) 

   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
   { 
       b = a + i; 
       ... 
   }
   ```
   - In the first loop, `n` and `a` are shared, `i` and `b` are private. In the second loop, `n` and `a` are shared, `i` is private, and `b` is explicitly private.

4. **What is the data scope of the variables in the following code?**
   ```c
   #include <omp.h>

   int a, b, c, n; 

   #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(a, b) 

   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
   { 
       // a and b are ? variables 
       // c and n are ? variables 
   }
   ```
   - `a` and `b` are private, while `c` and `n` are shared.

5. **How do the machines boot in Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP) with different Instruction Set Architectures (ISA)?**

       flag--;
   }

   int main(void) {
       struct sigaction sig;
       sig.sa_handler = SignalHandler;
       (void) sigemptyset(&sig.sa_mask);
       (void) sigaction(SIGUSR1, &sig, NULL);
       while (flag > 0);
       (void) printf("main terminates, flag = %d\n", flag);
   }
   ```

8. **Which is preferable: thread put in wait queue or a busy loop?**
   - Putting a thread in a wait queue is generally preferable as it avoids consuming CPU resources unnecessarily, unlike a busy loop.

9. **What determines which thread goes first once released?**
   - The thread scheduling policy of the operating system determines which thread goes first once released.

10. **How many actions are distinct?**
    - Actions are distinct based on their functionality and independence in the control flow graph.

11. **How many tasks are independent?**
    - Tasks are independent if they do not rely on each otherâ€™s results and can be executed concurrently without dependencies.

12. **Is there potential for parallelisation?**
    - Yes, if tasks are independent and can be executed concurrently, there is potential for parallelization.

13. **Discuss which pattern seems most relevant for grouping tasks, ordering tasks, and data sharing.**
    - The patterns relevant for this are Task Decomposition, Dependency Analysis, and Data Sharing patterns.

14. **Identify the data categories: read-only, effectively-local, read-write, accumulate, multiple-read single-write.**
    - Data categories help in understanding how data is accessed and modified by tasks:
      - Read-only: Data read by tasks without modification.
      - Effectively-local: Data modified by one task but not shared.
      - Read-write: Data read and written by tasks.
      - Accumulate: Data combined from multiple tasks.
      - Multiple-read single-write: Data read by multiple tasks but written by one.

15. **Is data decomposition feasible for the edge detection application?**
    - Yes, as edge detection can be divided into smaller tasks that operate on different parts of the image independently.

16. **What are the tasks in data decomposition?**
    - Tasks in data decomposition include breaking down the image into sections, processing each section for edge detection, and combining the results.

17. **Explain the granularity knob and the impact of granularity.**
    - The granularity knob refers to adjusting the size of tasks. Fine granularity means smaller tasks with more parallelism, while coarse granularity means larger tasks with less parallelism but reduced overhead.

18. **Explain the terms presented in task decomposition and dependency analysis.**
    - Task decomposition involves breaking down a problem into smaller tasks. Dependency analysis involves identifying dependencies among tasks to determine the execution order.

19. **What is a fork-join?**
    - Fork-join is a parallel pattern where tasks are split (forked) into parallel subtasks and then combined (joined) after execution.

20. **Explain the forces and solutions in the fork-join pattern.**
    - Forces include the need for parallelism and synchronization. Solutions involve using thread or process management to handle task execution and joining results.

21. **How do you allocate components in design space exploration?**

    - Mapping involves associating software functions with specific hardware units for execution, considering performance and resource constraints.

32. **What is the difference between a function and a procedure in software implementation?**

33. **How do you ensure data sharing over defined interfaces in task scheduling?**
    - By using synchronization mechanisms, data structures, and communication protocols.
