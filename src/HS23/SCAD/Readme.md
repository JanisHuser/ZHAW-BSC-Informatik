The idea of SCAD is to simplify the development, hence the engineers 

## Serverless Computing Paradigm


## Optimal Use Cases

- Single action repeats every time the user clicks on something
- Usage of services vary

## Developer Mindset

+ <span style="color: green;">Serverless architectures are application designs stat ... remove much of the need for a traditional always-on server component</span>
+ <span style="color: green;">Serverless architectures may benefit from significantly reduced operational cost, complexity, and engineering lead time</span>
- <span style="color: red;">Serverless architecture comes at a cost of increased reliance on vendor dependencies and comparativately immature supporting services</span>


## Formal Definition

**Serverless computing** is a **cloud computing paradigm** offering a high-level application **programming model** that allows one to develop and deploy cloud applications **WITHOUT** allocatign and managing virtualized serves and resources or being concerned about other operational aspects. The responsibility for operational aspects, such as fault tolerance or the elastic
